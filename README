pgtop version 0.11
==================

  pgtop is a PostgreSQL clone of `mytop', which in turn is a `top' clone for MySQL

  pgtop is a console-based (non-gui) tool for monitoring the threads
  and overall performance of PostgreSQL 7.2+. It
  runs on most Unix systems which have Perl, DBI, and Term::ReadKey
  installed. And with Term::ANSIColor installed you even get color.

  For more detailed information, look at the `mytop' page on sourceforge.net:
  http://mytop.sourceforge.net/

WARNING

  pgtop is a quick & dirty hack over `mytop', and not all MySQL concepts map
  very well onto PostgreSQL architecture and statistics collector. So don't
  expect a good quality out of this little hack...

  And, you should probably look for `ptop'.

INSTALLATION

  tar -zxvf pgtop-<version>.tar.gz
  cd pgtop-<version>
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

  There's no tests, actually.

DOCKER

  A ready-made Dockerfile is bundled in this repository.
  If you'd like to run pgtop from the docker container, all you need to do
  is to supply your own `.pgtop` configuration file.

  Build the docker container as:

     docker build -t my_pgtop .

  You most probably will want to run pgtop pointing it to your database
  rather than localhost:5432, so make sure to build a pgtoprc file
  from the provided sample `pgtoprc.sample`. After you've done that,
  run the docker container with:

     cp pgtoprc.sample pgtoprc

     # Edit the pgtoprc file to add your database host, port, name, etc..
     docker run --rm -it -v ./pgtoprc:/app/.pgtop my_pgtop

  Don't forget the `-it` options, or pgtop won't run with the necessary
  terminal capabilities to display anything in a meaningful way.
